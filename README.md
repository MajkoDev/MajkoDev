### My Front-End Stack.



#### Review of Last Year.
Last year, I had many plans and goal. Some of them I accomplished, some I have not and many of them I have started and will continue this year. I'm glad that I was able to work with **react framework** and create my portfolio with Chakra Ui and Graph Cms. Also, I learned using **Router 6**, **NextJs**, **Styled Components**, and even **React Query**. Late this year, I started work with **Tailwind Css**, which I enjoyed, and **Redux Toolkit**, which I must work with more to be completelly comfortable.

What I regret is not having time to learn and focus of using react with **Typescript** and also I wanted finally get to **testing** react applications. Another thing that I desired to work with is **Framer Motion**, but I looked to it and it doesn's looks complicated.






My React Stack, other tools I use and used with React, technologies I am going to learn:

**fundamentals** of react framework <br />
creating react application using **hooks** and **context** <br />
styling websites with basic tools and **css frameworks** and **Storybook** <br />
routing with  or frameworks like **Next.js** or **Gatsby** <br />
handling forms with pure react, **Formik** or **React Hook Form** <br />
managing state with **React Query** and **Redux Toolkit** <br />
**advanced** react development with **typescript** <br />
testing react applications with **libraries**, **Jest** and **Cypress**
