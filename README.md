**Review of Last Year** <br />
Last year, I had many plans and goal. Some of them I accomplished, some I have not and many of them I have started and will continue this year. I'm glad that I was able to work with **react framework** and create my portfolio with Chakra Ui and Graph Cms. <br />
Also, I progressed in learned using **Router 6**, **NextJs**, **Styled Components**, and even **React Query**. Late this year, I started work with **Tailwind Css**, which I enjoyed, and **Redux Toolkit**, which I must work with more to be completelly comfortable. <br />
What I regret is not having time to learn and focus of using react with **Typescript** and also I wanted finally get to **testing** react applications. Another thing that I desired to work with is **Framer Motion**, but I looked to it and it doesn's looks complicated. <br />
