Self-taught frontend developer living in Slovakia, near Trencin.

**REACT framework** for creating user interfaces and **Next.Js** for full stack web development (mixed feelings about the latest version), with **Typescript** as much as possible and **Tailwind Css** as the most popular solution for styling.

Other noteworthy libraries and technologies, **Redux Toolkit** and **Zustand** for state management, **Shadcn Ui** and **Framer Motion** for more professional desing, **Router** in react and vite applications, **Swr** or **React Query** when fetching api.


**Sanita** or **Strapi** as headless cms to manage content in websites, sometime **Firebase** or **Supabase** for more complex applications. Authentication with **Clerk**, payment with **Stripe**, deployment with **Vercel**.

In my plans for future, other than become better at what I already know, I would like to learn testing react applications, creating backend with Nodejs, MongoDb, Prisma,... and developing also mobile applications with React Native.
